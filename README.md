# Weather Dashboard

This project is centered on creating a site to help users organize and schedule their day. The basis was utilizing Bootsrap's grid system and components. Majority of the styling was provided in a boilerplate css file.

## Getting Started

Luckily this is a static site so there isn't much set-up to do. knowledge of javascript would be helpful if you would like to add more functionality to the planner.
View the site here: [Planner](https://dancornutt.github.io/UWB-05HW-DayPlanner/)
